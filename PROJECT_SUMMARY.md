# TaskFlow - Project Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

TaskFlow is a modern, secure, and extensible task management system. It supports user authentication, role-based access, project and task management, and is designed for both individual and team productivity.

---

## How the App Works

### Authentication & Roles

- **Login:** Users authenticate via username and password. Sessions are managed with secure tokens.
- **Roles:** There are two roles: Admin and User. Admins have full control; users can only manage their own tasks.

### Task Management

- **Admins:** Can create, assign, edit, and delete any task. Can assign tasks to any user.
- **Users:** Can create tasks (assigned to themselves), update their status, and view only their own tasks.

### Project Management

- Tasks can be grouped into projects, each with a color for easy identification.
- Projects can be created, edited, and deleted by admins.

### Dashboard

- Shows statistics: total, completed, pending, and overdue tasks.
- Quick access to today's and upcoming tasks.

### User Management

- Admins can add, edit, activate/deactivate, and delete users.
- User roles and status can be changed by admins.

### Security

- Passwords are securely hashed.
- All API endpoints enforce role-based access.
- All user input is sanitized and validated.

### Email Notifications

- When enabled, users receive an email when a task is assigned to them.

## What You Need to Know to Own This App

### Setup & Configuration
- **Setup:** See the README for step-by-step setup. The app is self-initializing and creates its own database.
- **Customization:** All business logic is in `/api/`. You can add new endpoints or features by editing these files.
- **Frontend:** The UI is in `index.php` and `assets/js/script.js`. You can change the look and feel via `assets/css/style.css`.
- **User Management:** Use the admin account to add/remove users and assign roles.
- **Data:** All data is stored in `data/tasks.db` (SQLite). You can back up or migrate this file as needed.
- **Security:** The app is secure by default, but you should always keep your PHP version up to date and use HTTPS in production.
- **Email:** To enable email notifications, configure your server's mail settings and uncomment the mail code in `api/tasks.php`.

### Technical Architecture

#### Frontend (JavaScript)
- **Main Class:** `TaskManager` in `assets/js/script.js`
- **Authentication:** Session tokens stored in localStorage
- **API Communication:** All data requests go through PHP API endpoints
- **UI Updates:** Real-time updates when tasks are created, edited, or status changes

#### Backend (PHP)
- **API Structure:** RESTful endpoints in `/api/` directory
- **Database:** SQLite with automatic schema creation
- **Authentication:** Token-based sessions with automatic expiration
- **Security:** Prepared statements, input validation, role-based access control

#### Database Design
- **Users Table:** Stores user accounts, roles, and authentication data
- **Sessions Table:** Manages active user sessions with expiration
- **Tasks Table:** Stores all task data with assignment tracking
- **Projects Table:** Organizes tasks into projects with color coding

### Key Features Implementation

#### Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin Role:** Full system access, user management, task assignment
- **User Role:** Limited to own tasks, cannot assign to others
- **API Enforcement:** All endpoints check user permissions before processing requests

#### Task Management System
- **Status Workflow:** Pending → In Progress → Completed
- **Assignment System:** Admins can assign to any user, users assign to themselves
- **Priority Levels:** High, Medium, Low with visual indicators
- **Due Date Management:** Optional dates and times with overdue detection

#### Project Organization
- **Color Coding:** Each project has a customizable color
- **Filtering:** Tasks can be filtered by project
- **Visual Indicators:** Project colors appear in task lists and forms

#### Dashboard Analytics
- **Statistics:** Real-time counts of total, completed, pending, and overdue tasks
- **Today's View:** Quick access to tasks due today
- **Upcoming View:** Shows tasks with approaching deadlines
- **Search & Filter:** Advanced filtering by status, priority, and project

### Security Implementation

#### Authentication Security
- **Password Hashing:** Uses PHP's `password_hash()` with bcrypt
- **Session Management:** Secure random tokens with 24-hour expiration
- **Token Storage:** Tokens stored in localStorage and sent via HTTP headers

#### Data Security
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** All queries use prepared statements
- **XSS Protection:** Input sanitization and output escaping
- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions enforced at API level
- **Input Validation:** All user input is validated and sanitized

### Deployment Considerations

#### Production Setup
- **Web Server:** Use Apache or Nginx with PHP
- **Database:** Consider migrating to MySQL/PostgreSQL for larger scale
- **Security:** Enable HTTPS, set proper file permissions
- **Backup:** Regular database backups
- **Monitoring:** Set up error logging and monitoring

#### Performance Optimization
- **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- **Database Indexing:** Add indexes for common queries
- **Asset Optimization:** Minify CSS/JS files
- **CDN:** Use CDN for static assets

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues
1. **Database Connection:** Check file permissions on `data/` directory
2. **Authentication Errors:** Verify session tokens and user roles
3. **API Errors:** Check browser console and server error logs
4. **Permission Issues:** Ensure proper user roles and login status

#### Debug Mode
- Enable error reporting in PHP for development
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Use `test_auth.php` to verify authentication system

## Final Notes

- The app is production-ready, but you can extend it as you wish.
- All code is well-commented and modular for easy maintenance.
- If you want to add features (like file attachments, comments, etc.), just extend the API and frontend accordingly.
- The system is designed to be scalable and can handle multiple users and projects.
- Regular backups of the database file are recommended for production use.
